# Optimize video for web sharing

Alfred Workflow for optimising video for web sharing.

## How it works

1. Grab a video file using Alfred's [universal action](https://www.alfredapp.com/universal-actions/)
2. Workflow will convert it to 1080p, 30fps mp4 file
3. Conversion takes time, so workflow will send you notification when video it is done and result ready to send.

## Requirements & Installation

1. [Install `brew`](https://brew.sh/)
2. Install `ffmpeg` â€” `brew install ffmpeg`
3. Download workflow from the [releases page](https://github.com/brachkow/alfred-web-video/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and install it
